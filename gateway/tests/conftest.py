"""Pytest fixtures shared across the gateway test suite.

Two fixtures matter:

* :func:`example_env` (autouse=False) — sets the env vars referenced by
  ``gateway.yaml.example`` so :func:`app.config_loader.load_config` succeeds
  in tests. Tests that need it import it explicitly.
* :func:`gateway_config_loaded_app` — yields a FastAPI ``app`` whose
  lifespan has run against the example config, so endpoints depending on
  ``app.state.config`` work. We do this by setting ``GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH``
  to point at the committed example file and then using FastAPI's lifespan
  entry/exit explicitly via :class:`LifespanManager`.

We intentionally don't autouse the env-var fixture: the ``test_health`` and
``test_main_no_config`` paths cover behaviors that must work *without* it.

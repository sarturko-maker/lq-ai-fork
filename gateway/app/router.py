"""Gateway request router (B4).

The router is the single choke point through which every chat-completion
request flows. It pulls together the four B4 responsibilities:

1. **Alias resolution** — translate the request's ``model`` field through
   ``gateway.yaml``'s ``model_aliases`` map. Multi-level aliases are
   supported (an alias whose ``primary.model`` is itself another alias);
   cycles are rejected at config-load time by
   :func:`app.config.GatewayConfig._aliases_have_no_cycles`.

2. **Tier derivation** — annotate every routed request with its
   ``routed_inference_tier`` (1-5) per PRD §1.5.2 / §3.13. Lookup order:
   ``inference_tiers.overrides[provider/model]`` →
   ``inference_tiers.overrides[provider]`` →
   ``inference_tiers.defaults[provider_type]`` → the provider entry's
   own ``tier:`` field.

3. **Adapter dispatch** — hand the resolved (provider, native model) pair
   to the right :class:`~app.providers.ProviderAdapter`. Adapters live in
   a name-keyed registry (``app.state.adapters``). New adapters in B6
   register without modifying the dispatch logic.

4. **Fallback chain** — when the primary provider fails (timeout,
   network, or 5xx upstream), iterate through the alias's configured
   ``fallback`` list and try the next adapter. The skeleton is in place
   in B4; real activation happens in B6 once additional adapters land
   (only Anthropic is shipped today). Unit tests with mocked adapters
   exercise the fallback path so the structure is verified now.

What B4 *does not* do
---------------------

* **Tier-floor enforcement / refusal.** Per PRD §4.4 / D1 the gateway
  refuses requests below a declared minimum with HTTP 403 and
  ``tier_below_minimum``. B4 only annotates; D1 is the refusal task.
  The error code is reserved in ``docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml``.
* **Anonymization.** M2 feature; flagged in the data model but not
  applied here.
* **Rate limiting.** Phase E task; the configuration loads but the
  enforcement middleware lands later.

    * A configured alias (``smart``) — fully resolved through any

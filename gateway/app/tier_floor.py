"""Tier-floor resolution + refusal helpers (D1).

Per PRD §4.4, every chat-completion request can declare a *minimum
inference tier* — a security floor the gateway must enforce.  Three
independent declarations contribute:

1. **Request override** — ``ChatCompletionRequest.minimum_inference_tier``.
   Per-call clamping. Highest specificity (one request).
2. **Project** — forwarded by the backend on
   ``ChatCompletionRequest.lq_ai_project_minimum_inference_tier`` when the
   chat lives in a project. The backend is authoritative on chat ↔
   project; the gateway only sees the value forwarded on the request.
3. **Skill** — ``Skill.minimum_inference_tier`` (frontmatter field per
   the skill-authoring guide). Each attached skill contributes its own
   floor; multiple attached skills mean ``min(floors)`` (the strictest
   declared skill floor wins).

**PRD §1.5.2 tier ordering: lower number = stronger security.**
Tier 1 (local Ollama, air-gap-capable) is the most secure posture.
Tier 5 (consumer / free tier) is the least secure. A
``minimum_inference_tier`` value of N means "require Tier N security or
stronger" — i.e., the routed tier must be **≤ N** (a lower-numbered or
equal tier is equally or more secure; a higher-numbered tier is weaker).

The **effective floor** is ``min(any of the three)`` — the declaration
requiring the strongest (lowest-numbered) tier wins. ``None`` from any
source means "no opinion"; we ignore it. If every source is ``None``, no
floor applies and the request is never refused on this axis.

Worked example: a project marked ``privileged: true`` defaults to
``minimum_inference_tier: 2``. The gateway allows Tier 1 (stronger) and
Tier 2 (the floor), and refuses Tier 3-5 (weaker than the floor).

When the resolved routed tier is weaker than the effective floor (i.e.,
``resolved_tier > floor.value``), the gateway responds **HTTP 403** with
the structured ``tier_below_minimum`` error envelope and writes a
routing-log row carrying ``refused=True`` and
``refusal_reason='tier_below_minimum'``. Per PRD §4.4 / D1
verification cases (a)-(d).

This module is pure logic — no FastAPI / no DB / no Pydantic. The route
handler in :mod:`app.api.inference` calls :func:`resolve_tier_floor`
after skill-prompt assembly (so skill floors are visible) and before
dispatch (so refusal happens before any upstream call).

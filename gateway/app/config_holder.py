"""Mutable config holder for hot-reload (D0.5).

Mirrors the C1 atomic-swap pattern (``api/app/skills/registry.py``)
adapted for the gateway's :class:`GatewayConfig`. The router and every
admin handler that reads config goes through :meth:`MutableConfigHolder.current`
(a single Python attribute fetch — atomic under CPython's GIL). The
write side serializes through ``_lock`` so concurrent reload attempts
do not race on the file or on the in-memory swap.

Hot-reload triggers (D0.5):

* **Explicit alias write** — ``PATCH``/``POST``/``DELETE`` on the admin
  alias endpoints write the file (atomically) and call
  :meth:`reload_from_disk` in-process.
* **SIGHUP** — operator-driven external trigger (mirrors C1's skill
  reload signal). The handler re-reads from disk; on validation failure
  it logs WARNING and KEEPS the old snapshot.

Validation is performed by re-running ``load_config`` (the same path
used at startup). If the new config does not validate, the holder
keeps the prior snapshot and surfaces a :class:`ConfigReloadError` so
callers can react. **The gateway never silently transitions to a
malformed config.**

In-flight requests are unaffected: each request resolves its alias
chain against the snapshot it captured at dispatch start. The Router
reads the current snapshot exactly once per ``chat_completion`` call;
a reload happening mid-call leaves that call on the old config and
the next call sees the new one.

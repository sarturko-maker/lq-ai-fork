"""LQ.AI Inference Gateway entrypoint.

The gateway loads ``gateway.yaml`` on startup, validates it via Pydantic,
and instantiates a :class:`~app.providers.ProviderAdapter` for every
configured provider whose credentials are present. A3 landed config
loading; B3 added the Anthropic adapter and the chat-completion data
path; B4 added the real router (alias resolution + tier derivation +
fallback skeleton) and the ``inference_routing_log`` writer.

If the config is missing or malformed the lifespan raises
:class:`~app.config_loader.ConfigLoadError` and the process exits
non-zero — the gateway is the security boundary, and silently coming
up with an empty config would mask operator misconfiguration. Adapter
construction failures (missing env vars) are *not* fatal; the affected
providers are skipped with a warning so the gateway still serves the
endpoints that don't need them. Likewise the ``DATABASE_URL`` is
optional — without it the gateway runs in ``NullRoutingLogWriter`` mode
(audit rows discarded). Operators see a startup warning so the gap is
visible.

Endpoint posture (current):

* ``GET  /health``                — 200 (liveness; independent of config).
* ``GET  /ready``                 — 200 once config has loaded; 503 otherwise.
* ``POST /v1/chat/completions``   — routes through :class:`app.router.Router`.
* ``POST /v1/embeddings``         — 501 (lands with B6 OpenAI adapter).
* ``GET  /v1/models``             — returns configured aliases.
* ``GET  /admin/v1/tier-config``  — returns loaded tier policy.
* Other ``/admin/v1/*`` endpoints — 501.

Configuration path resolution
-----------------------------

The lifespan reads the path from ``GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH``. Defaults:

* If ``GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH`` is set, use it (typical in containers; e.g.,
  ``/etc/gateway.yaml`` mounted from the operator's file).
* Otherwise fall back to ``./gateway.yaml`` relative to the process cwd
  (the repo-root file used during local ``uvicorn app.main:app`` runs).

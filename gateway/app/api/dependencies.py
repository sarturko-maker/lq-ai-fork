"""FastAPI dependencies shared across gateway routes (D0.5).

Today the only dependency lives here is :func:`require_gateway_key`, the
shared-secret check used by the admin write endpoints. The same secret
is already used by the C2 backend client when fetching skills; D0.5
extends it to the admin alias-CRUD surface so the backend (which holds
the secret in B5+) is the only entity that can mutate
``gateway.yaml``.

Why no separate "admin key": the brief is explicit. The backend's
``is_admin`` gate is the user-level authorization layer; the gateway's
shared secret is the service-to-service authentication layer. Adding a
third secret would expand the secret surface without strengthening the
threat model — a compromised backend already speaks the gateway-key
protocol, and a compromised gateway is the operator's bigger problem.

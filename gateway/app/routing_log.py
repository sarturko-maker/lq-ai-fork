"""``inference_routing_log`` writer.

The Tier-Derivation choke point per PRD §3.13 / §1.5.2 is the right
place to write the audit row: every routed request — successful or
failed — flows through here, so the log captures the operator's full
inference workload.

Schema authority: ``api/alembic/versions/0001_initial.py``. The writer
uses raw SQL (parameter-bound) rather than declarative models because
the gateway doesn't own this table — api/ does — and we don't want to
double-up ORM definitions across services. The schema is
forward-compatible with C3's ALTER TABLE that adds FK constraints to
``chats`` and ``messages``: those columns are nullable today and stay
nullable after C3.

Interface, not implementation
-----------------------------

The writer is split into a small protocol (:class:`RoutingLogWriter`)
plus two implementations:

* :class:`SQLRoutingLogWriter` — the real writer; persists via
  SQLAlchemy ``AsyncEngine``.
* :class:`NullRoutingLogWriter` — a no-op used when ``DATABASE_URL``
  is unset (e.g., in unit tests or in a degraded gateway with no DB).

The route handler depends on the protocol. Tests inject a
:class:`RecordingRoutingLogWriter` to assert exactly which fields the
router populated for each scenario without spinning up Postgres.

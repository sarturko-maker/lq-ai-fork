"""Pydantic models for the OpenAI-compatible gateway surface.

Every provider adapter consumes and emits these shapes; the gateway never
exposes a provider's native format to its callers. The field set tracks
:doc:`docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml` (the canonical contract per
:doc:`CLAUDE.md` decision routing) plus the LQ.AI extensions documented
there:

* ``minimum_inference_tier`` — refusal floor for the request (B4/D1).
* ``skill_name``             — audit-log routing tag (no inference effect).
* ``chat_id``                — UUID for audit-log correlation.
* ``anonymize``              — anonymization opt-in (M2; ignored before).

* ``routed_inference_tier``  — derived tier echoed in the response (B4).
* ``routed_provider``        — provider name that handled the call (B4).
* ``cost_estimate``          — USD estimate for the request (cost tracker).
* ``anonymization_applied``  — whether the M2 middleware ran (M2).

These extension fields are **populated by the gateway, not the adapter**.
B3 leaves them ``None``; B4 and downstream tasks fill them as they land.

Permissive policy
-----------------

Models use ``extra="allow"`` so unknown fields from a forward-looking
caller (or a streaming chunk variant we don't know about yet) round-trip
without rejection. The adapter only reads the fields it needs.

Streaming chunks
----------------

OpenAI's chat-completion streaming format emits a sequence of objects
with ``object="chat.completion.chunk"`` and partial deltas in each
``choices[i].delta``. We model both the chunk envelope
(:class:`ChatCompletionChunk`) and the delta payload
(:class:`ChatCompletionDelta`). The gateway serializes these as SSE
``data:`` lines per the OpenAI convention.

# The api service is the single owner of the database schema in the
# Compose stack. We run `alembic upgrade head` before exec'ing uvicorn
# so a fresh deployment lands a fully-migrated schema by the time the
# HTTP server accepts traffic. If migrations fail, this script fails —
# the container does not start a half-configured api.
#
# env.py's run_migrations_online() acquires a Postgres session-level
# advisory lock (MIGRATION_ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY) around the migration run,
# so multiple workers / replicas racing this step coordinate correctly:
# the first to acquire the lock applies migrations to head, the rest
# block then no-op once they see the schema is current (HS-1).
#
# Operators on a deployment that handles migrations out-of-band (an
# external job, a sidecar, Kubernetes pre-deploy hook, etc.) can
# disable the in-entrypoint step by setting LQ_AI_SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1.

# api server (surfaced 2026-05-16 when KB ingestion stopped completing
# after a worker image rebuild).

"""Document-pipeline ``arq`` worker — Task C5 (+ D6 cron jobs).

Run as a separate process via the docker-compose ``ingest-worker``
service::

    arq app.workers.document_pipeline.WorkerSettings

The worker:

1. On startup, opens a SQLAlchemy session-factory and an arq queue
   handle, then runs a sweep of any files stuck in ``pending`` /
   ``processing`` and re-enqueues them. This is self-healing across
   restarts: if a previous worker crashed mid-job and left a row at
   ``processing``, the next worker picks it up.
2. Consumes ingest jobs by file_id. Each job runs
   :func:`app.pipeline.ingest.ingest_file` against a fresh DB session.
3. Errors raised inside ``ingest_file`` (storage failures) bubble up
   to arq's retry mechanism. Failures inside the parser cascade
   are caught by ``ingest_file`` itself and translate to
   ``ingestion_status='failed'`` rather than retries.
4. Hosts the D6 GDPR jobs alongside the ingest pipeline:
   :func:`app.workers.user_export.export_user_data_job` (queued from
   the API on POST /users/me/export), :func:`...export_gc_job`
   (hourly cron sweeping expired bundles), and
   :func:`app.workers.user_deletion.hard_delete_due_users_job` (daily
   cron). Keeping all M1 background work in one worker process is
   simpler than running a separate cron container; the job-functions
   are independent enough that lock contention isn't a concern at
   single-tenant deployment scale.

Concurrency is configured via :data:`LQ_AI_INGEST_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`
in the settings. The default of 2 is conservative — bump it for
beefier deployments.

The worker keeps the API's :mod:`app.errors` hierarchy in scope so
exceptions from shared helpers render consistently in logs.

"""Matter-memory schemas — C3a (fork, ADR-F042): the matter-wiki write boundary.

The model-free half of the unit-of-work memory tier's auto-write path. The agent's
``update_matter_memory`` tool is a code-validated write (ADR-F018 shape): the model
PROPOSES the rewritten wiki, code DISPOSES against this schema BEFORE commit, a pass
is written, a failure is rejected back to the model with the reason (reject, never
truncate — a too-long wiki must be *consolidated* by the model, never silently cut;
ADR-F042 §Decision).

This module imports nothing from the agent/runtime layers and touches no I/O, so the
caps are unit-testable with no model and no DB. The pinned-correction request body
lives with its endpoint (``app.api.matter_memory``), mirroring how ``app.api.projects``
carries its own attach-request bodies.

"""HTTP API routers for the backend.

Each module under `app.api` corresponds to one tag-group in
`docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml`. In Task A4 (this scaffold), every endpoint
is registered but returns HTTP 501 with a structured "not implemented" body
that names the M1 task implementing it. Subsequent tasks (B1, B5, C3, C4,
C7, etc.) replace each 501 with a real handler.

Auth gating (Task B2): the `auth` and `users` routers are mounted without
a router-level auth dependency — they need different per-endpoint policies
(login is unauthenticated, /users/me must be reachable while
must_change_password is true so the client can read the flag, etc.). Every
other router is mounted under the `ActiveUser` dependency, which enforces:

1. A valid bearer token (401 without it).
2. `must_change_password = false` (403 with `password_change_required`).

This means future C-/D-phase implementations of these endpoints inherit
the auth+gate without any change at the handler level — they just need a
real handler body to replace the 501.

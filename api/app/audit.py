"""Audit-log writer — Task D3.

Per PRD §5.3: "Every state-changing API call writes to an
``audit_log`` table." This module centralises the shape of those
writes so:

* every call site populates ``privilege_marked`` and
  ``privilege_basis`` consistently — based on the affected
  project's ``privileged`` flag rather than ad-hoc per-handler
  reasoning;
* request context (``ip_address``, ``user_agent``, ``request_id``)
  is captured uniformly when the caller hands us the ``Request``;
* ``routed_inference_tier`` lands on inference-touching audit rows
  via the same code path as everything else.

The expected callsite shape is::

    from app.audit import audit_action

    await audit_action(
        db,
        user_id=user.id,
        action="project.create",
        resource_type="project",
        resource_id=str(project.id),
        project=project,
        request=request,
        details={"name": project.name, "privileged": project.privileged},
    )

The handler still calls ``await db.commit()`` afterwards — this
helper inserts the row and flushes but does not commit, so audit
writes ride the same transaction as the state change they describe
(no audit-row-without-state-change and no state-change-without-
audit-row failure modes).

Privilege resolution
--------------------

When ``project`` is provided as a :class:`Project` instance, the
helper reads ``project.privileged`` and ``project.id`` directly. When
only ``project_id`` is provided, the helper does a one-row lookup. If
neither is provided, the action is non-privilege-relevant and the
fields stay null/false (e.g., ``user.login`` has no project context).

Callers can also pass ``privilege_marked`` and ``privilege_basis``
explicitly when the action is privilege-bearing for a non-project
reason (e.g., admin-action audits in PRD §5.3 ¶"Role-bounded admin
actions audit").

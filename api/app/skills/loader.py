"""Filesystem walk + frontmatter parse + registry construction.

Public surface:

* :func:`load_registry` — walk a built-in skills directory and an
  optional community skills directory, parse each ``SKILL.md``, and
  build a :class:`SkillRegistry`. Built-in skills win on slug collision
  with community skills; duplicate community slugs are logged and
  skipped.
* :func:`install_sighup_reload` — register a SIGHUP handler that
  rebuilds the registry atomically when the operator signals the
  process.

Per ADR 0004 (skill-loader locus), the loader lives in the backend.
The walk runs synchronously inside the FastAPI lifespan startup — the
filesystem I/O is small and bounded (the M1 corpus is ~10 built-in +
dozens of community skills, each a few KB of frontmatter + body), and
putting it on a thread pool would add complexity without measurable
benefit.

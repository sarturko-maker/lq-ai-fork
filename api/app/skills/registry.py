"""In-memory skill registry with atomic-swap reload.

The registry maps ``name`` → :class:`SkillRecord` (a small struct
binding the parsed frontmatter, the body markdown, the raw YAML, and
the absolute path on disk). Reads — by both the API handlers and any
future C2 consumers — go through :meth:`SkillRegistry.list_summaries`
and :meth:`SkillRegistry.get_skill`.

Reload semantics: the loader builds a fresh :class:`SkillRegistry`
instance from the filesystem, and the live registry is *swapped*
atomically inside :class:`MutableSkillRegistry` (a thin holder used by
the lifespan handler). In-flight requests holding a reference to the
old registry continue to see the old state for the duration of their
handler call; new requests pick up the new state immediately. The swap
is a single Python attribute assignment, which is thread-safe under the
GIL — there's no torn read scenario.

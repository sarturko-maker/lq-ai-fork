"""S3 / MinIO async client for the api/ service.

Uses ``aioboto3`` so file uploads, downloads, and metadata operations stay
on the asyncio event loop. The full upload/download surface lands in Task
C4 (this module); A4's prerequisites (session-builder, ``ensure_bucket``,
``check_storage``) are unchanged.

We talk to MinIO with path-style addressing (``http://minio:9000/<bucket>/<key>``)
because virtual-hosted-style requires DNS magic that MinIO does not provide
inside the Compose network.

Streaming I/O
-------------

C4 requires streaming uploads (no full-body buffering) for the documented
100MB-per-request size cap. ``stream_upload`` consumes an
``AsyncIterator[bytes]`` (the FastAPI request stream), incrementally
SHA-256s every chunk, enforces the size cap, and pushes parts to S3 via
the multipart-upload protocol so we never need to know the body length up
front.

Streaming downloads use ``get_object``'s response body directly; we yield
chunks and the caller's ``StreamingResponse`` flushes them out.

Object key
----------

Per ADR 0005 we use the bare file UUID as the MinIO object key. Callers
pass the key in (the handler computes it as ``str(file.id)``); this module
does not synthesize keys.

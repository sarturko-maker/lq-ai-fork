# Audit Logging

> **Scope:** what LQ.AI records to the audit log, retention, and integrity protection. Operators evaluating procurement responses often need this in writing; this is the operational reference for the `audit_log` table.

## What is logged

Each audit event is a row in the `audit_log` table (see [docs/db-schema.md §audit_log](../db-schema.md) for the schema). Columns:

- `id` — UUID v7 primary key; time-ordered so the natural row order matches event order.
- `timestamp` — `TIMESTAMPTZ`, server-clock; default `now()` at insert.
- `user_id` — actor; FK to `users.id` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` so user deletion preserves the row but anonymises the actor.
- `action` — verb-form event string (e.g. `chat.message_sent`, `project.create`); the canonical event-type field.
- `resource_type` — noun the action was performed on (e.g. `chat`, `project`, `skill`).
- `resource_id` — stringified identifier of the affected resource, typically a UUID; nullable for actions with no concrete subject.
- `privilege_marked` — `BOOLEAN`, true when the action affects a project flagged privileged; first-class column (not buried in `details`) so operator queries do not require JSONB scans.
- `privilege_basis` — short human-readable handle for why the row is privileged (e.g. `project:<name>`); the DB enforces `privilege_marked → privilege_basis IS NOT NULL` via `chk_audit_log_privileged_with_basis`.
- `routed_inference_tier` — `SMALLINT 1..5` when the action touched inference routing; null otherwise.
- `routed_provider` — the provider the gateway selected for the routed call (e.g. `anthropic`, `openai`); null when the action did not route inference.
- `ip_address` — `INET`; the client address attached to the originating request.
- `user_agent` — request `User-Agent` header.
- `request_id` — correlation id from `X-Request-ID`; cross-references gateway logs and structured app logs.
- `details` — JSONB payload for action-specific fields (e.g. `{"name": "...", "privileged": true}`); queryable but not indexed by default.

Logged events at M1 (verified against actual `action=` literals emitted by `api/app/`; 42 distinct strings across 53 call sites):

- **Authentication & session:** `user.login`, `user.login_failed`, `user.login_mfa_challenged`, `user.logout`, `user.session_refreshed`, `user.session_refresh_failed`.
- **MFA lifecycle:** `user.mfa_setup_initiated`, `user.mfa_enabled`, `user.mfa_enable_failed`, `user.mfa_disabled`, `user.mfa_disable_failed`, `user.mfa_verify_failed`.
- **Password & credentials:** `user.password_changed`, `user.password_change_failed`.
- **Account lifecycle:** `user.role_updated`, `user.preferences_updated`, `user.deletion_scheduled`, `user.deletion_cancelled`, `user.export_requested`.
- **Project:** `project.create`.
- **Chat:** `chat.message_sent`.
- **Skills (user-scoped):** `user_skill.created`, `user_skill.updated`, `user_skill.deleted`.
- **Files:** `file.uploaded`, `file.deleted`.
- **Knowledge base:** `kb.created`, `kb.updated`, `kb.deleted`, `kb.file_attached`, `kb.file_detached`.
- **Saved prompts:** `saved_prompt.create`, `saved_prompt.update`, `saved_prompt.delete`.
- **Teams:** `team.created`, `team.updated`, `team.deleted`, `team.member_added`, `team.member_removed`, `team.member_role_changed`.
- **Admin / organization:** `organization_profile.updated`, `tier_policy.updated`.

All writes go through one helper — `app.audit.audit_action()` in [api/app/audit.py](../../api/app/audit.py) — so every row populates `privilege_marked` / `privilege_basis` consistently and captures `ip_address` / `user_agent` / `request_id` uniformly when a `Request` is available.

## What is NOT logged

- **Plaintext message content.** `chat.message_sent` records the chat and message ids in `details`, not the message body. Inference-routing has its own table (`inference_routing_log`) with provider, model, token counts and latency — also without message content, per PRD §4.
- **Provider API responses.** Same reasoning; the gateway records routing metadata only.
- **Cryptographic material.** `JWT_SECRET`, master keys, the field-level encryption keys, and provider API keys are never logged — see [encrypted-keys.md](encrypted-keys.md) for the key-handling contract.
- **Read traffic.** M1 audits state-changing actions (PRD §5.3). Read endpoints are not audited unless they touch privileged data via the inference path, in which case the routing decision lands in `inference_routing_log`.

## Retention

- **Default retention:** audit rows are never automatically deleted at M1. Operators with regulatory retention requirements (e.g. SOC 2 expects ≥1 year; some jurisdictions require longer) can rely on the default-retain posture.
- **User deletion behaviour:** when a user is deleted, the FK `audit_log.user_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so the audit row persists but the actor reference is anonymised. The state-change history remains queryable by `resource_type` / `resource_id` / `details`. The user-data export worker (`api/app/workers/user_export.py`) bundles a user's own audit rows into their export under `audit_log.json` before deletion executes.
- **Operator-controlled archival:** operators can `pg_dump --table=audit_log` to long-term storage on a schedule of their choosing. No first-class export workflow in M1; we may add one if operator demand surfaces.
- **Manual purge:** operators with privacy-driven purge requirements (e.g. GDPR right-to-erasure) can DELETE specific rows by `user_id` directly. A future enhancement may add a `redact_user(user_id)` CLI command that NULLs the actor and PII-bearing `details` fields per user (tracked as a deferred enhancement; file via operator request — see PRD §9).

## Integrity protection

- **Application-layer:** the api process is the sole writer. `audit_action()` flushes the audit row inside the caller's transaction but does **not** commit; the handler commits both the state change and the audit row in one boundary. An event is therefore either both present in the audit log and reflected in the underlying tables, or neither — there is no audit-row-without-state-change and no state-change-without-audit-row failure mode.
- **Append-only at the application layer:** no application code path issues `UPDATE` or `DELETE` against `audit_log`. The database does not enforce append-only directly; operators with stricter requirements can add a trigger that rejects updates and deletes (the schema comment in `docs/db-schema.md` flags this).
- **Database-layer:** Postgres WAL provides crash-consistency. Operators with stricter durability requirements run Postgres with `synchronous_commit=on` (the default in our chart).
- **Tamper detection (not in M1):** chained hashes (each row commits a hash over `(prev_hash, current_row)`) would let operators detect after-the-fact tampering. Not in M1; tracked as a deferred enhancement (file via operator request — see PRD §9). Operators needing this today can use Postgres logical replication to a write-once destination.

## Operator workflows

### Investigating an incident

Pattern: pull all events for a given actor in a time window.

```sql
SELECT timestamp, action, resource_type, resource_id, privilege_marked, details
FROM audit_log
WHERE user_id = '<uuid>'
  AND timestamp BETWEEN '<from>' AND '<to>'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

To narrow to privileged-resource activity:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, privilege_basis
FROM audit_log
WHERE privilege_marked = TRUE
  AND timestamp BETWEEN '<from>' AND '<to>'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

Both queries are supported by indexes (`idx_audit_log_user_timestamp`, `idx_audit_log_privileged`).

### Long-term archival

```bash
# Weekly archive
pg_dump -d lq_ai --table=audit_log --data-only --column-inserts \
  > audit-log-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).sql
```

### Compliance attestation

Operators answering "do you maintain an audit log of administrative actions" can reference this doc plus the `audit_log` table schema in `docs/db-schema.md`. The Compliance Alignment Pack at `docs/compliance/` (separate cycle) maps specific audit events to specific SOC 2 / ISO 27001 controls.

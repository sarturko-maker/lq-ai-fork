## What this is

A new document at `docs/compliance/owasp-llm-top10.md` that maps each of the ten risks in the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (current published version, see https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) to LQ.AI's architecture, mitigations, residual risk, and operator responsibility. Each risk row cites into specific files in the repository so a reviewer can verify the mitigation in source.

Where a mitigation is partial — the Citation Engine is M2, the Anonymization Layer is M2 — the document names the gap directly: which structural slot exists today, what the operator can verify today, and what lands later. Honest disclosure of partial mitigation is the deliverable, not aspirational claims.

## Why it matters

The OWASP LLM Top 10 is the de facto procurement framework for AI-product security review. When an operator's security team is asked to bless an LLM-touching tool, the OWASP LLM mapping is the first artifact they look for; absence of one is treated as a signal the vendor hasn't thought through AI-specific risks. The frameworks the project already maps against (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR) cover the application-security and privacy surface; the LLM Top 10 covers the AI-specific surface the operator's security team will not find in those mappings.

The mapping is also the artifact a closed-source vendor cannot match in shape. Their LLM Top 10 response, if published at all, asserts mitigations without citing the implementation. Here, each mitigation cites a specific file and line range. LLM01 (Prompt Injection) cites the skill-assembler conventions in [`gateway/app/skills/assembler.py`](../../../gateway/app/skills/assembler.py) and the threat-model coverage in [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](../../security/threat-model.md). LLM06 (Sensitive Information Disclosure) cites the audit log writer and the master-key workflow in [`docs/security/encrypted-keys.md`](../../security/encrypted-keys.md) — and names the Anonymization Layer's deferred status honestly. The operator's security reviewer reads the cited files and forms their own judgment.

The post-attestation procurement posture treats source verifiability as a first-class trust signal alongside paid attestation. The LLM Top 10 mapping is one of the cleanest examples of why: every claim points to source, none of the claims terminate in a paid intermediary.

## What we'd ship

One new file:

```
docs/compliance/
└── owasp-llm-top10.md       # NEW — 10 risk sections + cover + scope notes
```

Document structure:

```
# OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications — LQ.AI Alignment

## Scope and limits
What this document is. What it is not (it is not a certification; it is a
mapping of mitigations to specific implementation, with residual risk
named honestly).

## How to read this document
Each risk has five fields:
  - Threat as it applies to LQ.AI's architecture
  - Structural mitigations (design choices baked into the codebase)
  - Operator-configured mitigations (defaults that can be tuned)
  - Residual risk (what is not mitigated, with the deferral path if known)
  - Operator responsibility (what the operator must do to close residual risk)

## LLM01 — Prompt Injection
[Threat / Structural mitigations / Operator-configured / Residual / Operator responsibility]

## LLM02 — Insecure Output Handling
[...]

[... LLM03 through LLM10 ...]

## Out of scope
Risks in the LLM Top 10 that are not applicable to LQ.AI's architecture
(e.g., LLM10 Model Theft largely does not apply to a project that does not
train models; the mitigation is to document that the project does not host
proprietary model weights).
```

Per-risk content lives in five paragraphs:

1. **Threat as it applies to LQ.AI's architecture.** Specific. Names the trust boundaries from [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](../../security/threat-model.md).
2. **Structural mitigations.** Cites specific file paths. For LLM01: skill-prompt isolation conventions per ADR 0007 and the assembler in `gateway/app/skills/assembler.py`; structured-output schemas; the Citation Engine's architectural slot. For LLM02: response validation in the FastAPI handlers (Pydantic models); the chat-message persistence layer's escaping. For LLM03 (Training Data Poisoning): not applicable — the project does not train models; cite this fact and name the inference-provider responsibility.
3. **Operator-configured mitigations.** Tier policy, model-checksum verification (deferred — name it honestly), audit-log retention, RBAC scope. Each item cites the config knob.
4. **Residual risk.** What is not mitigated. The Citation Engine and Anonymization Layer are M2 — name them as gaps under LLM06 and LLM09 with the deferral citation into PRD §3.3 / §4.7. Do not claim the gap is closed.
5. **Operator responsibility.** Human-in-the-loop review (the legal-profession default), operator's incident response, tier-policy choices the operator owns.

Every cited file path must resolve. A CI link-check job verifying the citations is part of the deliverable (a small `scripts/check-compliance-citations.py` that scans the doc for `code-cite` markers and asserts the file/line range exists).

## How we'd know it's done

- [ ] `docs/compliance/owasp-llm-top10.md` exists and covers all ten risks in the current OWASP LLM Top 10 published version (LLM01 through LLM10).
- [ ] Every risk row has the five fields populated (threat / structural / operator-configured / residual / operator responsibility).
- [ ] Every "structural mitigation" claim cites at least one specific file path + line range, and every cited path resolves at the commit the PR targets.
- [ ] The Citation Engine and Anonymization Layer are named as gaps under the relevant risks (LLM06, LLM09) with citations to [PRD §3.3](../../PRD.md#33-citation-engine-exact-quote) and [PRD §4.7](../../PRD.md#47-anonymization-layer-m2). The document does not claim these capabilities are shipped.
- [ ] A "How to read this document" section distinguishes structural mitigations (in source, verifiable) from operator-configured mitigations (defaults the operator tunes).
- [ ] A CI job verifies all cited file paths resolve. The job can be a small Python script invoked from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; the script's path and the job snippet are part of this PR.
- [ ] The document is referenced from [`docs/compliance/README.md`](../../compliance/README.md) (status table updated) and from [PRD Appendix E](../../PRD.md#appendix-e--pre-empted-procurement-objections) (the prompt-injection objection links to LLM01).
- [ ] A non-maintainer security architect can read the document and produce concrete follow-up questions rather than "this is marketing copy."

## Where to start

1. Read the current OWASP LLM Top 10 at https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ — note the published version number.
2. Read [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](../../security/threat-model.md) — the STRIDE coverage is the substrate for several risk rows.
3. Read [`docs/security/cryptography.md`](../../security/cryptography.md) and [`docs/security/encrypted-keys.md`](../../security/encrypted-keys.md) for the key-management surface (relevant to LLM06).
4. Read the gateway's skill-assembler at [`gateway/app/skills/assembler.py`](../../../gateway/app/skills/assembler.py) and ADR 0007 ([`docs/adr/0007-skill-prompt-assembly.md`](../../adr/0007-skill-prompt-assembly.md)) — the skill-prompt isolation conventions are the foundation of the LLM01 mitigation story.
5. Read the gateway admin endpoints at [`gateway/app/api/admin.py`](../../../gateway/app/api/admin.py) — note the anonymization-config 501 stub around line 270; this is the honest-disclosure example for LLM06 and LLM09.
6. Read the citation endpoint at [`api/app/api/chats.py`](../../../api/app/api/chats.py) around line 1174 — the M1 behavior is "empty until citation engine ships," which is the honest disclosure for LLM06 and LLM09 on the citation-verification axis.
7. Read [PRD §3.3 Citation Engine](../../PRD.md#33-citation-engine-exact-quote), [PRD §4.7 Anonymization Layer](../../PRD.md#47-anonymization-layer-m2), and [PRD Appendix E](../../PRD.md#appendix-e--pre-empted-procurement-objections) for the substantive content that backs several risk rows.
8. Read [`docs/security/audit-logging.md`](../../security/audit-logging.md) and the audit writer at [`api/app/audit.py`](../../../api/app/audit.py) — relevant to LLM04 (Model Denial of Service / observability) and LLM08 (Excessive Agency / audit).
9. Confirm the tier-floor refusal path in [`gateway/app/tier_floor.py`](../../../gateway/app/tier_floor.py) — relevant to LLM08 (Excessive Agency).
10. Draft section-by-section, citing into source as you go. The first three sections (LLM01, LLM02, LLM06) will surface most of the conventions you reuse for the remaining seven.

## Scope cuts (what's out of scope for this PR)

- Mitigations not yet shipped get documented as "gap, see [PRD §X.Y]" — not as "this is a known weakness in the design." The Citation Engine is M2, deliberate; it is not a known weakness to be apologized for.
- The OWASP API Security Top 10 (a different mapping, also relevant) is its own document and is not in scope here.
- The OWASP ASVS L2 verification matrix is a separate, larger deliverable; it is not in scope.
- Per-skill prompt-injection detection rates (measured numbers) are deferred to the eval-harness work; this PR documents the architectural defenses, not the measured detection rates.
- Cross-references to MITRE ATLAS are valuable but not required for this PR; if the contributor wants to add an "Also see ATLAS technique X" sidebar per row, that is welcome but not part of acceptance.

## How this strengthens the project

The OWASP LLM Top 10 mapping is the artifact an operator's AI-security reviewer asks for first; it is also the artifact that distinguishes a serious AI-product security posture from marketing copy. Every claim in the document cites into source. The operator's reviewer reads the cited file and forms their own judgment. A closed-source vendor's equivalent document, if it exists, asserts the mitigation without showing the implementation; here, the implementation is the citation. That structural difference is the project's central trust commitment, expressed in the format the AI-security community has standardized on.

Beyond the procurement surface, the document is a forcing function for the engineering team: every gap honestly named in the document is a backlog item the team agrees to either close or document the residual-risk story for. Honest disclosure is internally aligning, not just externally trustworthy.

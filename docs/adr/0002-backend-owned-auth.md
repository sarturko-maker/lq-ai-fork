# ADR 0002 — Backend (FastAPI) owns authentication

**Status:** Accepted (2026-05-07)
**Decision-makers:** Kevin Keller (initial maintainer)
**Affected components:** `api/`, `web/`, `word-addin/` (M3)

## Context

PRD v0.1 stated that "v1 uses OpenWebUI's built-in auth: local accounts, OAuth, SAML, LDAP/AD, SCIM 2.0, trusted-header SSO." The OpenAPI sketches drafted alongside v0.2, however, specified a complete auth surface owned by the FastAPI backend (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/mfa/*`, `/api/auth/refresh`, etc.). The Word add-in (M3) was always going to authenticate against a backend endpoint, not against the OpenWebUI fork.

Two architectures had been on the table:

**Option A — OpenWebUI owns auth.** The Web client uses OpenWebUI's built-in auth; the backend trusts session cookies or trusted-header SSO from OpenWebUI; the Word add-in either re-implements OpenWebUI's auth or uses a separate backend auth path. Identity store is OpenWebUI's database (or whatever IdP OpenWebUI is configured against).

**Option B — Backend owns auth.** The FastAPI backend implements all auth flows. The OpenWebUI fork is configured to delegate to the backend's auth endpoints; the Word add-in (and any future client) uses the same endpoints. There is one identity store, one session model, one audit-log trail.

During M1 planning, several factors made Option B the simpler architecture in practice:

- **Single source of truth.** The audit-log requirements in [PRD §5.3](../PRD.md#53-audit-logging) — particularly `privilege_marked`, `privilege_basis`, and `routed_inference_tier` correlation across login, chat, file, and inference events — work cleanly when one service owns the identity-and-session model.
- **Word add-in (M3) parity.** The Word add-in was always going to use the backend, not OpenWebUI. Two auth paths in v1 to consolidate later was strictly worse than one auth path from the start.
- **MFA, recovery codes, and per-user export/delete.** The M1 deliverable surface (MFA-mandatory option, GDPR Article 17 deletion, GDPR Article 20 export) is cleaner to implement once, in one service, against one schema.
- **OpenAPI surface is already drafted.** The backend OpenAPI sketch already specified the auth endpoints in detail. Reversing course to OpenWebUI-owned auth would have meant rewriting the sketch and de-scoping the Word add-in's auth work.

## Decision

**The InHouse AI FastAPI backend owns authentication.** All clients (the OpenWebUI fork, the Word add-in, and any future surface) authenticate via the backend's auth endpoints.

**Identity store.** The `users`, `user_sessions`, and related tables in the InHouse AI Postgres database (per [`docs/db-schema.md`](../db-schema.md)) are the canonical identity store. There is no parallel OpenWebUI auth database.

**Session model.** Short-lived JWT access tokens (~15 min) plus refresh tokens (default 7 days, hashed at rest in `user_sessions`). Refresh tokens rotate on use. Programmatic clients use scoped API tokens.

**IdP integrations.** OAuth (Google, Microsoft, GitHub), SAML 2.0, LDAP/AD, SCIM 2.0, and trusted-header SSO are first-class — implemented in the backend as pluggable auth providers, not as an OpenWebUI configuration.

**OpenWebUI fork integration.** The fork is configured to disable its built-in auth and delegate to the backend. The login UI in `web/` calls `/api/auth/login`; the chat session uses the JWT access token; logout calls `/api/auth/logout`. The fork does not maintain a parallel session.

**MFA.** TOTP via `pyotp` in M1; WebAuthn is a tracked enhancement (DE-### TBD). Recovery codes are single-use, hashed at rest, rotated on re-enrollment.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- One identity store, one session model, one audit log. Cross-event correlation (login → chat → inference call → privilege flag) works without joining across services.
- Word add-in (M3), Slack/Teams bridge (M3), and any future surface all use the same auth endpoints — no parallel work.
- The OpenAPI surface that procurement-evaluators read matches what the backend actually does.

**Negative:**

- The OpenWebUI fork loses the rich built-in IdP integrations OpenWebUI ships out of the box. We re-implement OAuth, SAML, LDAP, SCIM in the backend.
- Rebasing the OpenWebUI fork (per [ADR 0001](0001-openwebui-fork-pin.md)) needs to re-confirm that auth-delegation glue still works after each rebase. This is part of the rebase PR test plan.
- The MFA implementation in M1 is TOTP-only. WebAuthn is deferred. Operators with WebAuthn-mandatory policies will need to wait or front the deployment with Authentik/Keycloak.

**Mitigations:**

- The OAuth/SAML/LDAP/SCIM surface in the backend is documented in the OpenAPI sketch (PRD decision-routing #2) so the implementation is anchored, not improvised.
- The OpenWebUI fork's auth-delegation glue is a small isolated module under `web/src/lib/inhouse-ai/auth/` (per ADR 0001's customization-organization principle), making it easy to verify after rebases.
- Operators with complex IdP needs can front the deployment with Authentik or Keycloak via reverse proxy — the backend trusts the proxy's authenticated headers (per the PRD §5.1 reverse-proxy recipe).

*Updates to PRD §5.1 reflect this decision; PRD v0.2 (May 2026) carries the updated text. The earlier "v1 uses OpenWebUI's built-in auth" language is preserved here in the Context section as the historical position so future maintainers can recover the reasoning.*

# F067 — The module model: one vocabulary for agent capabilities + the org-authored content harness

- Status: accepted (maintainer, 2026-07-08)
- Date: 2026-07-08
- Deciders: maintainer (Arturs) + agent lead
- Slice: B-0 (Workstream B, `docs/fork/plans/PIVOT-modular-azure.md`)
- Relations: **extends ADR-F065** (reopens D7 — the org-authored deferral — WITH the harness D7
  demanded; the Store/Library/Binding model itself is unchanged); F062 (grants-stay-code —
  untouched, load-bearing here); F010 (gateway-only model binding — untouched); F016/F017 (skill
  backend + subagent skill scoping); F034 (fan-out roster); F041 (skills as the craft layer);
  F049 (tier middleware + the data-only fence pattern); F050 (Practice Knowledge invariants —
  referenced, NOT implemented); F054 (per-matter toggles); F055 (tabular as a matter tool);
  F057 (AI-compliance area, on the stacked AIC branch). Milestone re-plan:
  `docs/fork/plans/MODULES-milestone.md`.

## Context

The maintainer's Workstream B intent (PIVOT 2026-07-07, verbatim): *"Deep Agents built from modules
like lego. The trick is it needs to work."* A non-technical admin walks a set-up wizard: start from
prebuilt profiles (Commercial, Privacy), connect skills / knowledge / playbooks / tools, configure
sub-agents without touching JSON, and configure human-in-the-loop. This ANSWERS task #472 and
absorbs G12/G13 (`docs/fork/plans/ONBOARD-admin-experience.md`).

The substrate facts (verified in code this slice; map: `docs/fork/plans/CAPABILITY-SOURCES-birdseye.md`):

1. **One live pipeline, one chokepoint.** Capabilities reach a Deep Agent only via
   Store → Org Library (`org_library_entries`) → area binding → `build_area_inventory`
   (`api/app/agents/capabilities.py:487` — fail-closed, REQUIRED-kwarg) → composition
   (`api/app/agents/composition.py:664`) → the R6 `guarded_dispatch` grant seam. Everything this
   ADR adds must pass through that same pipeline — no second resolution path.
2. **The authoring surfaces are orphaned.** `/lq-ai/skills/new` → `user_skills` rows the runtime
   registry never reads (it is filesystem-only, `app/skills/registry.py`); the playbook builders
   write rows whose only Deep-Agent touchpoint is the read-only Practice Playbook tier; knowledge
   uploads (`knowledge_bases`) are consumed only by the frozen legacy `autonomous/` path.
3. **F065 D7 deferred exactly this** ("no org-authored content… an injection surface requiring its
   own harness + ADR") and reserved the `org` namespace tier. This ADR is that harness + ADR.
4. **A load-bearing frontmatter fact, found while drafting:** deepagents 0.6.8's `SkillsMiddleware`
   parses an `allowed-tools` key from SKILL.md frontmatter and renders it into the agent's system
   prompt ("`-> Allowed tools: …`", `deepagents/middleware/skills.py:887`). The fork's own
   frontmatter schema has no such field and grants are code (F062) — so `allowed-tools` cannot
   *mint* a tool — but on an org-authored skill it would be a model-steering line injected
   verbatim into the system prompt. Our parser is also permissive (`extra="allow"`,
   `app/skills/schema.py:180`), so unknown org frontmatter keys would ride through silently, and
   two shipped fields are behaviour-bearing (`minimum_inference_tier`, `ensemble_verification`).
5. CLAUDE.md doctrine binding this design: org-authored content is untrusted model input;
   transparency is load-bearing; "system proposes, user owns"; reject-don't-sanitize at boundaries.

## Considered Options

1. **Wire org-authored content straight into the runtime** (registry merges live `user_skills`
   rows; project KBs auto-searchable) — no Library step, no gate. Smallest diff. Rejected: it is
   the exact ad-hoc path F065 D7 forbade — live-editable, unreviewed instruction-tier content
   reaching every colleague's agent with no provenance and no approval; violates the untrusted-input
   doctrine outright.
2. **A parallel "org modules" system** — separate tables, separate admin UI, separate resolution
   order beside the Store/Library. Rejected: duplicates the adopt→bind→compose pipeline; two
   adoption surfaces with different semantics is precisely the mental-model confusion F065 removed.
3. **One Library, one pipeline, per-kind runtime seams + a propose→approve harness (CHOSEN).**
   Org-authored content joins the SAME Store→Library→binding→`build_area_inventory` pipeline under
   a new `org` source, gated by a human review harness; each module kind keeps its own (existing
   or new) runtime seam.
4. **Defer org authoring entirely; the wizard orchestrates shipped content only.** Honest and
   cheap, but it refuses the maintainer's core ask (G12: *"give those created skills, playbooks
   and knowledge to the agents in a controlled manner"*) — the wizard would stitch a library the
   org cannot add to.

## Decision Outcome

**Option 3**, as six recorded sub-decisions. Each is deliberately separable so the maintainer can
overturn one without unwinding the rest.

### D1 — The module vocabulary (one table, five kinds + one future kind)

A **module** is the admin-facing unit of agent capability. Kinds, with where each is authored,
where it lives, how it binds, how it reaches the agent, and its injection-risk class:

| Module kind | Authored | Lives | Binds to an area | Reaches the agent at runtime | Injection-risk class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Skill** | shipped: repo `skills/` (+ community submodule); org: the existing builder (`/lq-ai/skills/new`, `user_skills`) → the D2/D3 harness | shipped: filesystem registry (`app.state.skill_registry`); org: approved immutable snapshot rows (D3.2) | `practice_area_skills` ∩ Library | listed by SkillsMiddleware; body read on demand via the read-only `RegistrySkillBackend` (`app/agents/skill_backend.py`) | **INSTRUCTION** (highest — a skill IS instructions by design) |
| **Knowledge collection** | `/lq-ai/knowledge` upload (`knowledge_bases` + chunks, existing ingest) | SQL + object storage (unchanged) | NEW `practice_area_knowledge_bases` join (B-3) ∩ Library (new kind `knowledge`) | NEW knowledge tool group: a guarded read tool over the existing `hybrid_search` (`app/knowledge/retrieval.py:82`); results injected as fenced DATA | **RETRIEVED-DATA** (fenced; tool output never instructions) |
| **Playbook** | `/lq-ai/playbooks` + easy builder (`playbooks`/`playbook_positions`) | SQL (unchanged) | `practice_area_playbooks` ∩ Library (exists) | read-only Practice Playbook tier text (`PRACTICE_PLAYBOOK_PROMPT` fence, `composition.py:323`) | **GUIDANCE-DATA** (fenced, "data not instructions") |
| **Tool group** | CODE ONLY — `TOOL_GROUP_REGISTRY` (`capabilities.py:215`); orgs never author tools | code | `practice_area_tool_groups` ∩ Library (exists) | built per run; every dispatch through R6 `guarded_dispatch` | **CODE** (grants never data — F062 invariant) |
| **Sub-agent profile** | admin UI over `practice_areas.agent_config.subagents` (B-5) — no JSON exposed | `practice_areas.agent_config` JSONB | intrinsic to its area (not a Library entry — see below) | deepagents declarative specs via `build_area_subagents` (`area_agent.py:121` — strict key allowlist, `model` rejected per F010, `skills` ⊆ area per F017) | **INSTRUCTION** (admin-authored, config-validated) |
| **MCP server** | FUTURE — its own approval-gated milestone (ADRs 0014/0015) | — | placeholder exists (`MCP_PLACEHOLDER`) | — | out of scope here |

Two boundary calls inside D1:

- **Sub-agent profiles are area config, not Library content.** A sub-agent references modules (its
  skill subset); it is not itself adoptable/shareable content. Making it a Library kind would force
  an adopt step onto something that only means anything inside one area's roster. If cross-area
  sub-agent sharing is ever wanted, that is a future ADR.
- **Knowledge collections join `org_library_entries` as a new kind `knowledge`** (extend the CHECK
  constraint; key = `knowledge_bases.id::text`, mirroring the playbook convention). Unlike skills
  they need no propose/approve harness of their own: their content reaches the model only as
  fenced RETRIEVED-DATA through a guarded read tool, never as instructions — adoption + binding is
  the control. (The chunks remain untrusted model input like any retrieved document; the fence and
  the tool's no-action-on-content posture are the existing doctrine.)

### D2 — The org-authored path (reopens F065 D7)

**Author in the existing builders → PROPOSE to the Library under the reserved `org` source →
HARNESS (D3) → adoptable → bindable → composed.** No new authoring surface is built; universe 2's
builders stay as they are. What is new is the bridge: a propose action, an admin review queue, and
an approved-snapshot store the runtime reads.

- **Approval pins bytes, not a row.** Approving a proposal creates an **immutable approved
  snapshot** (content + frontmatter + a content hash + approver + timestamp). The runtime serves
  ONLY approved snapshots — never the live-editable `user_skills`/`playbooks` row. Editing after
  approval mints a new version that needs re-approval; the old approved version keeps serving
  until then. Without this, a post-approval edit silently bypasses the gate (TOCTOU) and the
  review is theatre.
- **No shadowing in v1.** F065 D7 structured the namespace so a future `org` tier *could* shadow a
  catalog slug. We decide NOT to use that yet: a propose whose slug collides with a shipped
  catalog name is rejected (409). A shadowed "contract-qa" that silently replaces the shipped one
  is a supply-chain trick, not a feature; if shadowing is ever wanted it gets its own decision with
  an explicit "org version overrides shipped" badge.
- **Roles:** authoring stays open where it is today (the builders' existing authz); PROPOSE is any
  authenticated author for their own artifact; APPROVE/REJECT is `AdminUser`. Self-approval by a
  solo admin is permitted (a two-person rule would deadlock every small org); the audit row makes
  it visible. This is deliberately weaker than F050's "never the contributing lawyer" curator rule
  — F050 governs *agent-proposed* learnings (a different pipeline, still future); this governs
  human-authored artifacts an admin consciously publishes to their own company's legal team.

### D3 — The harness (real, ship-sized controls — all of them, none optional)

1. **Mandatory human review gate.** Nothing org-authored becomes adoptable without an explicit
   admin approve action. The gate is a human decision, not a machine verdict — recorded as such.
2. **Immutable approved snapshots** (D2) — the runtime never reads a mutable row.
3. **Strict frontmatter allowlist at propose time (reject, don't sanitize).** Org skill
   frontmatter validates against a CLOSED schema: `name`, `description`, and under `lq_ai:` only
   `title`/`version`/`author`/`tags`/`jurisdiction`/`output_format`/`trigger_examples`. Everything
   else is a 422 naming the offending key. Explicitly DENIED: **`allowed-tools`** (deepagents
   renders it into the system prompt — context fact 4; an org skill must not be able to advertise,
   let alone request, tools the area didn't bind), **`minimum_inference_tier`** and
   **`ensemble_verification`** (cost/behaviour-bearing — tier floors and verification come from
   area/matter/deployment config, never from org prompt content). Any key outside the allowlist —
   including `inputs` and anything credential-shaped (`_validate_refs` posture, NORTH-STAR inv 3) —
   is likewise a 422. The shipped corpus keeps its permissive parser; strictness applies at the
   org propose boundary only.
4. **The tool-grant hole, closed in two layers.** Layer 1 is already structural and this ADR keeps
   it: a tool enters `GuardContext.granted` ONLY via `TOOL_GROUP_REGISTRY` ∩ area rows ∩ Library ∩
   toggles — no skill text, org or shipped, can mint a grant (F062; R6 fail-closes on anything
   else). Layer 2 is new: the D3.3 denial of `allowed-tools` removes even the prompt-steering
   surface, so an org skill cannot decorate the system prompt's skill list with tool names.
5. **Provenance labels wherever the content is shown AND wherever it is injected.** Shown: the
   Store/Library/binding pages render a `source='org'` badge with author + approver (the STORE-2
   D-A badge slot already exists; playbooks finally get a non-None source). Injected: the served
   SKILL.md body is prefixed at snapshot time with a one-line provenance banner
   (*"Provenance: org-authored by {author}, approved by {approver} on {date} — your company's own
   material, not LQ-shipped."*) so the model and any transcript reader see origin at the point of
   use. **Honesty note:** a skill is INSTRUCTION-class — it cannot be data-fenced the way the
   TierMemoryMiddleware tiers are (F049), because being instructions is its purpose. The banner is
   provenance, not a fence; the *fence-equivalent* for this class is the human gate (D3.1) plus
   the grant invariant (D3.4). RETRIEVED-DATA and GUIDANCE-DATA kinds keep real fences (existing
   `PRACTICE_PLAYBOOK_PROMPT` / tool-output framing).
6. **Size caps.** Org SKILL.md capped (proposal: 32 KiB total; the shipped corpus sits far below)
   — rejected at propose. Caps a hostile or accidental context-flooding skill before it can tax
   every run's token budget (F051).
7. **Audit rows on every transition**: `library.propose` / `library.approve` / `library.reject` /
   `library.revoke` + the existing `library.adopt`/`remove` — carrying kind/key/version/content-hash
   and counts ONLY, never content (the audit contract).
8. **Revocation.** An admin can revoke an approved version; revocation removes it from the
   adoptable set and (if adopted/bound) drops it at the same chokepoint — `build_area_inventory`
   fail-closes exactly as it does for a registry-drifted name today, and the D6/F065 confirm-modal
   posture applies (list affected areas, no silent agent change).

**Considered and REJECTED (heavier alternatives):**

- **LLM-based injection screening** (a gateway call classifies each proposed skill for injection
  before approval). Rejected: an LLM verdict gating a write contradicts the ADR-F018
  deterministic-gates doctrine; the screener is itself prompt-injectable by exactly the content it
  screens; and a "screened ✓" badge would over-claim safety and erode the human gate's felt
  responsibility. If ever added, it is an advisory reviewer aid (review-not-gate, the F041 option-2
  framing), never the gate.
- **Quarantined dual-agent review** (a sandboxed agent reads the skill and reports). Rejected for
  v1: O-series-shaped machinery, real cost, and it still terminates in a human judgment — start
  with the human judgment.
- **Label-only (badges, no approval gate).** Rejected: fails CLAUDE.md's untrusted-input rule for
  shared instruction-tier content; a badge does not stop a poisoned skill reaching colleagues.

### D4 — The agent profile (what "Commercial" / "Privacy" IS, and where it lives)

An **agent profile** is a **versioned, shipped, declarative bundle**: practice-area config
(`profile_md` doctrine, `unit_label`, tier floor, `default_budget_profile`) + module bindings
(skills / tool groups / playbooks / knowledge, by kind+key) + sub-agent roster
(`agent_config.subagents` specs) + HITL policy defaults (D5 placeholder).

**It lives as in-repo profile manifests** (e.g. `profiles/commercial.yaml`), loaded read-only like
the skills catalog — NOT as seeded migration rows, NOT as a new mutable SQL table of bundles.
Options weighed:

- *Seeded rows (status quo):* the shipped defaults are today spread across six migration literals
  (`RECOMMENDED_LIBRARY_SETS`' provenance note) — G6 showed this is unmaintainable and invisible.
- *A profiles SQL table:* makes shipped catalog content mutable org state — the exact
  Store-vs-Library confusion F065 exists to remove.
- *In-repo manifests (CHOSEN):* follows the substrate's existing law — shipped catalog = files/code
  (skills = filesystem, tool groups = code, recommendations = a drift-guarded constant), org state
  = rows. A manifest is transparency-friendly (readable in the source, per CLAUDE.md), versionable,
  and diff-reviewable like code.

**Applying a profile is COPY, not link** ("system proposes, user owns"): the wizard materialises
real rows (create/patch the area, adopt Library entries, write bindings, set the roster) in one
transaction; the admin owns them afterwards. No live sync back — a profile update ships as a new
manifest version and re-apply is an explicit, diff-shown admin action. `RECOMMENDED_LIBRARY_SETS`
folds into the manifests when B-7 lands (its drift-guard tests move with it).

### D5 — HITL policy: the named seam, deliberately not designed here

The concept is named **"HITL policy"**: a per-area policy declaring which tool classes / action
kinds require the agent to STOP AND ASK a human before executing (e.g. "applying a redline",
"sending anything externally", "any write above N documents"). Reserved now: a
`practice_areas.hitl_policy` JSONB column (default `{}`), rendered in the area admin page as a
visible-but-inert section, and a doctrine sentence that the policy exists.

It is NOT designed in this ADR because the substrate question is open: pausing a model-driven run
mid-tool-call needs langgraph interrupt/resume semantics on deepagents 0.6.8 (checkpointer
interaction, our lease/settle runner, SSE frames for a paused state, resume authz). That is the
**B-6 research spike**, which produces its own ADR. The only commitment made here: whatever lands
must interpose at (or beside) the `guarded_dispatch` chokepoint — the one seam that already sees
every fork tool dispatch — never as a parallel enforcement path.

### D6 — Non-goals (stated so scope cannot creep silently)

- **No marketplace / multi-org sharing** — one org's Library, full stop.
- **Practice Knowledge (F050) stays future** — this harness governs *human-authored* modules; the
  agent-proposed shared-learning pipeline keeps F050's stricter invariants and its own milestone.
- **Legacy executors stay frozen** — the wizard configures Deep Agents only; playbooks reach agents
  as data (positions tier), never as executor pipelines.
- **No remote `lq-skills` sync** (birdseye candidate F — maintainer: not priority; supply-chain
  surface for later).
- **No MCP wiring** — ADRs 0014/0015 gate it; the kind is named in D1 so the vocabulary doesn't
  need reopening when it arrives.

## Consequences

- **Good:** one vocabulary for everything the wizard touches; org-authored content finally reaches
  Deep Agents through the SAME fail-closed chokepoint as shipped content (no second resolution
  path to audit); the injection posture is honest per risk class (human gate for instructions,
  fences for data, code for grants); profiles give the wizard a real, versioned starting point and
  kill the migration-literal seeding pattern; F065's Store/Library mental model is completed, not
  contradicted — D7's deferral is discharged by the harness it asked for.
- **Bad / cost:** a new security-sensitive surface (propose/approve/snapshot) that gets the deeper
  ADR-F005 review on every slice; snapshot storage + versioning adds schema (migrations) and an
  admin review queue adds UI; the no-shadowing rule means an org cannot "fix" a shipped skill in
  place (they author under a new name — accepted, revisit only with an explicit override badge
  design); profile manifests are one more shipped-content format to keep drift-guarded.
- **Honest limits:** the human review gate is a judgment gate, not a proof — a subtle prompt-injection
  can pass a human reader; the mitigations are provenance-at-point-of-use, the grant invariant
  (a poisoned skill still cannot mint tools or exceed R4/R5/R6 brakes), revocation, and the B-2c
  red-team eval (findings, ADR-F015). HITL depth is unresolved until the B-6 spike.
- **Invariants untouched:** gateway-only egress (F010), grants-in-code (F062), `guarded_dispatch`
  R4/R5/R6 on every agent action, audit counts/types/IDs, the Citation Engine, the SKILL.md format,
  read-only shared memory tiers (F049), matter auto-write-then-correct (F042).
- Slices + verification: `docs/fork/plans/MODULES-milestone.md` (B-1…B-7).

## Implementation addendum — B-2a (2026-07-08, appended; the decisions above are unchanged)

The harness backend for kind=skill landed as slice B-2a (migration 0091). Five implementation
calls worth recording, all within the D2/D3 envelope:

1. **Proposal state lives on `org_skill_versions` itself** (states `proposed → approved |
   rejected`; `approved → superseded | revoked`) — `user_skills` is untouched, so the live
   user/team chat-shadow path carries zero risk from this slice. `superseded` is set only by a
   newer approval of the same slug, never by an endpoint. Partial unique indexes enforce one open
   proposal and one live approved version per slug.
2. **The provenance banner is rendered at serve time** from snapshot metadata, not baked into the
   stored bytes: the approver and approval date do not exist at propose time, and the content
   hash must cover exactly the bytes the admin reviewed. The stored snapshot is the author's
   bytes; `served_skill_md` prefixes the D3.5 banner as a body blockquote at the wiring seam.
3. **Later shipped-slug collisions warn, never swap silently.** Propose 409s against the current
   registry (D2 no-shadowing), but a *later* shipped release can still mint the same slug — the
   runtime then serves the shipped skill and logs `org_skill_shadowed_by_shipped`.
4. **Revoke leaves the `org_library_entries` row in place** — the drop happens at
   `build_area_inventory` (fail-closed, `skill_unresolved_skipped` warning), and the member
   Library read shows the dangling entry, mirroring registry-drift semantics. Removing the
   adoption stays an explicit admin action with the F065 D6 confirm posture.
5. **The platform operator is excluded from the org-skills admin surface** (list / approve /
   reject / revoke return 403 via `tenant_admin_visibility`): the review queue exposes
   tenant-authored legal know-how, which ADR-F064 walls off from platform operations. Approval
   is therefore a *tenant org-admin* act — consistent with D2's roles, which never contemplated
   the operator.

Also fixed in-flight (adversarial review): approve's supersede is two-step-flushed because
SQLAlchemy orders same-table UPDATEs by primary key, which could transiently violate the
one-approved-per-slug index; transitions row-lock (`FOR UPDATE`) to close the check-then-write
window; `registry is None` (skills off) fails org skills closed at BOTH chokepoints.

## Implementation addendum — B-3 (2026-07-08, appended; the decisions above are unchanged)

The knowledge-collection module landed as slice B-3 (migration 0092). Five implementation calls
worth recording, all within the D1 envelope:

1. **The derived-group ruling.** The adopted unit is the `kind='knowledge'` Library entry (key =
   `knowledge_bases.id::text`), NOT a tool group: the `search_knowledge` tool group materialises
   in composition iff ≥1 ENABLED knowledge collection resolves for the run (bound via
   `practice_area_knowledge_bases` ∩ adopted into the Library ∩ not matter-toggled off). The
   group is COMPOSITION-ONLY (`COMPOSITION_ONLY_GROUP_KEYS` in `app/agents/capabilities.py`):
   it stays in `TOOL_GROUP_REGISTRY` so `build_area_tool_groups` can build it, but it is fenced
   out of every `kind='tool'` surface — the Store tool catalog, the Library adopt endpoint
   (422, exactly like an unknown key), the area tool-group bind endpoint (404, exactly like an
   unregistered group), and bound-row resolution in `build_area_inventory` (a stray
   `practice_area_tool_groups` row naming it is dropped fail-closed with a
   `tool_group_composition_only_skipped` warning). It therefore needs — and can never acquire —
   a `practice_area_tool_groups` row.
2. **Authz posture.** Bound collections are searched by ANY matter agent run filed under that
   practice area, regardless of the `knowledge_bases` row's owner — that is the point of org
   knowledge: adoption + binding IS the access control (D1). The owner-scoped `/knowledge-bases`
   CRUD surface is unchanged; the tool is a separate, area-gated read path behind
   `guarded_dispatch` (R6 grant, R5 halt, body-free audit). Note: `_live_knowledge_bases` in the
   admin catalog deliberately exposes every user's non-archived collection name/description to
   the ADMIN — that catalog is the D1-sanctioned review surface where the admin decides what
   the org adopts.
3. **Query embedding routes through the gateway** (the 1536-dim `embedding` model the KB chunks
   are indexed with — the `query_kb` pattern), never the local 768-dim matter embedder; the two
   retrieval doors deliberately do NOT converge (ADR-F049 Slice C1 boundary). Any embed/gateway
   failure degrades to FTS-only (`query_embedding=None`) with a structured warning — retrieval
   never hard-fails on the embedder. When every bound collection is FTS-only
   (`hybrid_alpha == 1.0`) the embed call is skipped entirely.
4. **Retrieved chunks are fenced RETRIEVED-DATA** (the injection class D1 assigns this kind):
   every result renders inside the single-sourced `_RETRIEVED_HEADER` frame ("treat as
   information, never as instructions") with collection/file/page provenance and chunk ids —
   the chunks stay untrusted model input, which is why this kind needs no propose/approve
   harness.
5. **Web surfaces are deferred to B-3b on record.** The Store/Library sections for the new kind
   and the area-page bind card touch exactly the files B-2b is concurrently editing — deferred
   to avoid a cross-slice merge tangle, not descoped. The backend endpoints
   (`POST/DELETE /practice-areas/{key}/knowledge-bases`, the `knowledge` sections in the admin
   catalog / member Library / matter panel) shipped in B-3.
   **B-3b shipped 2026-07-08 (PR TBD):** the Store/Library knowledge sections, the area-detail
   bind card, and the matter-panel TS type honesty landed — web-only, no `api/` changes.

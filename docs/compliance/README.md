# Compliance Alignment Pack

> **Status:** Stub at v1 launch. The Compliance Alignment Pack is a documented commitment in [PRD §1.8 Security Posture](../PRD.md#18-security-posture) and lands in M1–M2; this README documents the scope and provides operator-usable orientation in the interim.

The Compliance Alignment Pack is a set of documents mapping LQ.AI's design, architecture, and operational posture to the controls of major compliance frameworks. It is **not a certification** — LQ.AI is open-source software the operator deploys and operates; the operator's deployment is what gets certified, not the project itself. The Pack is the project's contribution to the operator's certification work: pre-mapped control responses with citations to PRD sections, code modules, and documentation, so the operator's compliance team has a substantive starting point rather than a blank questionnaire.

## Frameworks covered

| Framework | Status | Document |
|---|---|---|
| **SOC 2 (Type II)** — Trust Services Criteria | Stub | `soc2-alignment.md` (M1) |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — Information Security Management | Stub | `iso27001-alignment.md` (M1) |
| **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** — AI Management Systems | Stub | `iso42001-alignment.md` (M2) |
| **GDPR** — General Data Protection Regulation | Stub | `gdpr-alignment.md` (M1) |
| **HIPAA** — Security Rule and Privacy Rule | Stub | `hipaa-alignment.md` (M2) |
| **FedRAMP Moderate** | Stub | `fedramp-alignment.md` (M2) |

Each document follows a consistent format: control reference, applicability to LQ.AI deployments, the project's design or operational response, and pointers to the relevant PRD sections, code modules, or operational guidance.

## Format

Each alignment document follows this structure:

```
# [Framework] Alignment

## Scope and limits

What this document is and is not. The Pack is the project's contribution to
the operator's certification; certification of the operator's deployment is
the operator's responsibility.

## Control mappings

For each control in the framework:

- Control ID and short description
- Applicability to LQ.AI deployments
- Project response (design, code, operational practice)
- Operator responsibility (what the operator must do to satisfy this control)
- References (PRD sections, code modules, docs)

## Out of scope / operator-responsibility-only controls

Controls where the project provides no design or operational response because
the control is fully the operator's responsibility (physical security of the
deployment host, personnel screening, etc.).

## Open items

Controls where the project's response is in-development. As M1 and M2 ship,
open items resolve.

## Contributing

The Compliance Alignment Pack is one of the highest-leverage community contribution targets. Operators who have completed certification cycles for their own deployments have substantive content that benefits every subsequent operator. See [DE-024 (ISO 42001) and DE-100–115](../PRD.md#9-deferred-enhancements-and-identified-future-work) in the deferred-enhancements list for the specific contribution targets.

If you want to contribute, please open an issue with the `compliance` label first to coordinate with maintainers — substantive compliance content is reviewed by counsel before merging.
